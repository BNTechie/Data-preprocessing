# Data-normalization 

Normalizing a dataset is an essential step in data preprocessing, especially when using algorithms that rely on the distance between data points (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, SVMs, and neural networks). There are several methods to normalize data in Python, each with its own use case and implications. Here are some of the most common normalization techniques:

***Min-Max Scaling***

***Standardization (Z-score Normalization)***

***Robust Scaler***

***MaxAbs Scaler***

***Normalization***
