# Outlier-detection-and-removal

Outlier detection is a crucial step in data analysis as outliers can significantly affect the results of statistical analyses and machine learning models. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data, and they can arise due to various reasons such as measurement errors, data entry errors, or inherent variability in the data.

#### Importance of Outlier Detection

- **Impact on Statistical Measures:** Outliers can skew mean, variance, and other statistical measures, leading to incorrect conclusions.

- **Model Performance:** Outliers can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models by affecting the modelâ€™s ability to learn the underlying pattern of the data.
  
- **Data Quality:** Identifying and handling outliers can improve the overall quality of the dataset, leading to more reliable analysis.

#### Methods for Outlier Detection and Removal in Python
Here are some common methods for detecting and removing outliers:

#### Z-Score Method
#### Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
#### Isolation Forest
#### DBSCAN
