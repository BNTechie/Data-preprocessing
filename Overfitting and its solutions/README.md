# Example-case-of-overfitting-and-methods-to-reduce-it

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new, unseen data. This [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/BhadraNivedita/Example-case-of-overfitting-and-methods-to-reduce-it/blob/main/Overfitting%20example%20.ipynb) 
 demonstrate this with a simple dataset, using a decision tree classifier, and then apply different techniques to resolve overfitting.
